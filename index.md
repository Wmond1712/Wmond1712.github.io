### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

I enjoyed working on Lab 4, part 1, as I liked having to convert the units of each measurement. I also liked the partner I had during this lab because we were able to talk things out and ask for help. I also enjoyed being able to be helped by and ask my partner for help.

* Lab 6

My favorite one to work on was Lab 6, part 2. Being able to create a game of Blackjack was very fun. It was also very interesting having to code the value of different cards and whether an ace was worth 1 or 11.

* Lab 9

I liked working on Lab 9, part 1 as it was the first lab/part that I could finish completely on my own. Most of the time I always had to ask my partner or the TA for help as there was always at least one small detail or part that I didn't know how to do. Being able to accomplish something on my own felt great.
